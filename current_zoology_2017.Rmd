The data for this paper were gathered by two undergraduates as part of their honors thesis. I found no evidence of any problems with the data. There are, however, issues with the analyses and figures. 


```{r load-data, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
f <- here("data", "Foster.etal.CurrentZoo2017_Original.xlsx")

single <- read_excel(f, sheet = "Single Density Survival Data") %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate(`Survived (1/0)...13` = as.numeric(`Survived (1/0)...13`),
         `Survived (1/0)...25` = as.numeric(`Survived (1/0)...25`)
         )

double <- read_excel(f, sheet = "Double Density Survival Data") %>% 
  slice(-1) 
         
snail_original <- bind_rows(
  single = single, 
  double = double, 
  .id = "Density"
) %>% 
  rename(trial_ID = `Trial ID...1`,         
         snail_ID = `Snail ID...2`,
         seastar_ID = `Sea Star ID...3`, 
         snail_width_mm = `Snail Width (mm)...4`, 
         survived_01 = `Survived (1/0)...13`) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(snail_ID)) %>% 
  verify(survived_01 == `Survived (1/0)...25`) %>% #check duplicate columns identical
  select(-matches("\\.{3}")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(survived = if_else(survived_01 == 1, "Alive", "Dead"), 
         survived = factor(survived, levels = c("Alive", "Dead")), 
         density = factor(density)) 
```


## Table 2

Table two, which shows the correlations between snail behavior and shell size, can be reproduced perfectly, implying that the data are the correct version and have been imported correctly.

```{r correlations}
drop_upper_tri <- function(x) {
  x[upper.tri(x)] <- ""
  x
}

#reproduces
snail_original %>% 
  select(snail_width_mm, peak_height_cm, average_height_cm, average_time_out) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  round(4) %>%
  drop_upper_tri() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  gt::gt()

```


## Figure 1

Figure 1 showing shell sizes cannot be replicated - outliers have been removed. The published figure's size range is 16--24 mm, whereas the size range in the data is 11--26 mm.

```{r published-fig1, fig.cap = "Forster et al figure 1. Original caption 'Box plots detailing the relationship between snail shell width and survival rates of C. funebralis in mesocosm trials. Dots represent putative outliers, lines represent 10th and 90th percentiles, gray boxes indicate the interquartile range, and the central line depicts the median.'"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "foster-fig1.jpeg"))
```


```{r figure-1, fig.cap = "Reproduction of figure 1, with jittering"}

size10_90 <- snail_original |> 
  group_by(survived) |> 
  summarise(
    ymin = quantile(snail_width_mm, 0.1),
    q25 = quantile(snail_width_mm, 0.25),
    m = quantile(snail_width_mm, 0.5),
    q75 = quantile(snail_width_mm, 0.75),
    ymax = quantile(snail_width_mm, 0.9))

ggplot(snail_original, aes(x = survived, y = snail_width_mm)) +
  geom_linerange(data = size10_90, aes(x = survived, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, fill = "grey60", coef = 0) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1, aes(colour = density)) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Alive", "Dead")) + #to match inconsistency in published
  labs(y = "Shell Width (mm)", x = "")


```

## Figure 2

Figure 2 showing average height reached by the snails cannot be replicated. As with figure 1, outliers have been removed. Average height in the published figure is 0--3 mm, whereas the maximum average height in the data is over 7 mm.

```{r published-fig2, fig.cap = "Forster et al figure 2. Original caption 'Box plots showing differences in average height reached above water by surviving versus dead C. funebralis in our mesocosm trials. Dots represent putative outliers, lines represent 10th and 90th percentiles, gray boxes indicate the interquartile range, and the central line depicts the median.'"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figs", "foster-fig2.jpeg"))
```

```{r average-height-out-water}

height10_90 <- snail_original |> 
  group_by(survived) |> 
  summarise(
    ymin = quantile(average_height_cm, 0.1),
    q25 = quantile(average_height_cm, 0.25),
    m = quantile(average_height_cm, 0.5),
    q75 = quantile(average_height_cm, 0.75),
    ymax = quantile(average_height_cm, 0.9))
  
ggplot(snail_original, aes(x = survived, y = average_height_cm)) +
  geom_linerange(data = height10_90, aes(x = survived, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, fill = "grey60", coef = 0) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0, aes(colour = density)) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Dead", "Alive")) + #to match inconsistency in published
  labs(y = "Average Height out of Water (cm)", x = "")
```

## GLMM model

The generalised linear mixed model described in the methods seems appropriate, except for the choice of link function.

> We used a GLMM with a binomial error distribution and log--link function to evaluate selection on prey traits.

Binomial with log-link is possible but unusual. This model fails to converge for me with a log-link. This may simply be a typo for logit.

I cannot reproduce the published model output with the GLMM

```{r}
contrasts(snail_original$density) <- c(-1, 1) #jmp default contrast

model <- glmer(
  survived ~ density + snail_width_mm + average_height_cm + (1|trial_id) + (1|seastar_id), 
  family = binomial(link = "logit"), # log link fails 
  data = snail_original)
broom.mixed::tidy(model)

```

```{r}
drop1(model, test = "Chisq")

```



## Using a glm

If I replace the GLMM with a GLM, which ignores the random effects, I can perfectly reproduce the published model output.

```{r}
model_glm <- glm(
  survived ~ density + snail_width_mm + average_height_cm, 
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data = snail_original)
broom::tidy(model_glm) # shows z-score rather than chi-sq but is correct

drop1(model_glm, test = "Chisq")

```

The coefficients are similar for the GLMM and GLM, but the standard errors are larger in the GLMM. If the model described in the paper had been used,  density and average height, which are both reported as highly significant predictors of survival, would not be significant predictors, rendering much of the discussion and conclusions moot.
